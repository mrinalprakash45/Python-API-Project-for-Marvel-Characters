# Python API Project for Marvel Characters

The Marvel Comics API is a tool to help developers everywhere create amazing, uncanny, and incredible websites and applications using data from the 70-plus years of the Marvel age of comics. The Marvel Comics API is a RESTful service that provides methods for accessing specific resources at canonical URLs and for searching and filtering sets of resources by various criteria. All representations are encoded as JSON objects.

You can access six resource types using the API:

- Comics: individual print and digital comic issues, collections, and graphic novels. For example: Amazing Fantasy #15.
- Comic series: sequentially numbered (well, mostly sequentially numbered) groups comics with the same title. For example, Uncanny X-Men.
- Comic stories: indivisible, reusable components of comics. For example, the cover from Amazing Fantasy #15 or the origin of the Spider-Man story from that comic.
- Comic events and crossovers: big, universe-altering storylines. For example, Infinity
- Creators: women, men, and organizations who create comics. For example, Jack Kirby.
- Images: image of the Marvel Character which you searched for.
- Characters: the women, men, organizations, alien species, deities, animals, non-corporeal entities, trans-dimensional manifestations, abstract personifications, and green amorphous blobs which occupy the Marvel Universe (and various alternate universes, timelines, and altered realities therein). For example, Captain America.
